module Ronin
  #
  # Classes or objects can include {PostExploitation} so they can declare
  # what specific resources they leverage. To leverage a resource the
  # class or object must first declare the resource:
  #
  #     leverage :fs
  #
  # Objects will then gain a `#fs` method, which will return an
  # {PostExploitation::Resources::FS} object. {PostExploitation::Resources}
  # contains classes that provide convience methods for leveraging
  # resources. In turn, these convience methods call methods defined in the
  # object which leverages the Resource. For example,
  # the {PostExploitation::Resources::FS#mkdir} method relies on the
  # `fs_mkdir` method to handle the making of the directory:
  #
  #       leverages :fs
  #       # ...
  #
  #       #
  #       # Injects a `mkdir` command.
  #       #
  #       def fs_mkdir(path)
  #         inject_command("; mkdir #{path}; ")
  #       end
  #
  #     # ...
  #     obj.fs.mkdir('.temp')
